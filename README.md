This project on life expectancy is about finding the most important features that impact Life Expectancy. The dataset has most of the world's life expectancy data with important features such mortality rates, infectious diseases, and features such as alcohol consumption of a country. 
In this project I have used plenty of Data Cleaning techniques to improve my regression models. 
The most important feaatures unsuprisingly was the status of a country's develpment. The result makes sense becasue developed countries provide their citizen's with good health and civil benefits.
